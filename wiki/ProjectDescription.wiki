#summary Project description as it appears on the project home page

Gurtle is a [http://tortoisesvn.net/ TortoiseSVN] issue tracker plug-in (an [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/svn/tortoisesvn/trunk/contrib/issue-tracker-plugins/inc/IBugTraqProvider.idl IBugTraqProvider] implementation) for [http://code.google.com/hosting projects hosted at Google Code].

With release 1.5, TortoiseSVN introduced the possibility for anyone to author a COM-based plug-in that enables a user to query a project's issue tracking system during a commit. Gurtle is such a plug-in and enables the user to consult issues of a project hosted by Google Code from within the [http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-commit.html#tsvn-dug-commit-basics TortoiseSVN Commit dialog box]. The screenshot below shows how the issue dialog box looks like in Gurtle for the [http://code.google.com/p/support/ project hosting support] project.

When you select one or more issues, Gurtle appends the number and summary of each issue to the commit log message.

Gurtle's issue browsing dialog box sports the following notable features:

  * Download of issues in the background
  * Sort issues by clicking on column headers
  * Conduct free-text and interactive search along one or across all dispalyed columns
  * Search issues as download happens in the background
  * See closed in addition to open issues
  * Unowned/Unassigned issues appear visually distinct (dimmed)
  * Closed issues appear visually distinct (struck-out)
  * Notification of version updates
